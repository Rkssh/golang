# Golang Application

This is a simple Golang application that serves a webpage with a blue background and the text "It is working!" displayed. You can run this application on your local machine without using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your machine:

- Go (version 1.17 or higher) yes

## Getting Started go project

Follow these steps to run the application manually on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: Dipu singh

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd <project-directory>
   ```

3. Build the application:

   ```
   go build
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```
   ./<executable-name>
   ```

5. The application should now be running. Open a web browser and visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see a blue page with the text "It is working!" displayed.

6. To stop the application, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the application is running.

## Customization
